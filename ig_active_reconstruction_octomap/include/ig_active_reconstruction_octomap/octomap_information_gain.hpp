/*! Defines the interface for information gain calculators as well as providing

 * functionality like occupancy and entropy calculation.
 *
 * Information gain classes are called while casting rays from a sensor position
 * through the octomap. Before a new ray is cast, makeReadyForNewRay() is
 * called, then includeRayMeasurement(...) is called on every voxel the ray
 * traversed but the last one, for which includeEndPointMeasurement(...) is
 * called. If a ray was cast through empty (unknown, uninitialized) space
 * solely, informAboutVoidRay() is called. The calculated information gain is
 * retrieved after the last ray was cast through getInformation().
