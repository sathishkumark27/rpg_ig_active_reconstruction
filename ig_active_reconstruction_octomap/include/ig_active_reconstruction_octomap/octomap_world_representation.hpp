         * parameter of the function. It must be a templated type where the
         * first template argument is the TREE_TYPE. It is automatically
         * templated on the TREE_TYPE used within the world representation. If
         * the linked object expects other template arguments apart from the
         * tree type, those can be appended as further function template
         * parameters. Whatever inputs necessary as constructor argument for the
         * object type can be passed as arguments to the function.
         *
         * Example:
         * ******************************************
         * StdPclInput is a class to feed pcl pointclouds into the octomap
         * octree to which it is linked. It is templated on octree and
         * pointcloud types and takes a StdPclInput::Config object as optional
         * constructor argument.
         *
         * Given an already existing "config" object it could be created
         * through: auto std_input = std::make_shared<
         * StdPclInput<IgTree,pcl::PointCloud<pcl::PointXYZ>> >(config);
         *
         * and then linked to a WorldRepresentation<IgTree> "world" through:
         * WorldRepresentation<IgTree>::Link link = world.getLink();
         * std_input.setLink(link);
         *
         * This can be shortcut with this function, while at the same time
         * automatically deducing the TREE_TYPE (IgTree in the example) of the
         * world representation to which the StdPclInput is to be linked. The
         * following call is equivalent to the above three commands: auto
         * std_input = world.getLinkedObj<StdPclInput,
         * pcl::PointCloud<pcl::PointXYZ> >(config);
         *
         * @tparam INPUT_OBJ_TYPE Class type of the object for which a
         * shared_ptr shall be created. Must be templated on at least one
         * argument, where the first one must be the tree type.
         * @tparam TEMPLATE_ARGS (variadic) Further optional template arguments
         * of the INPUT_OBJ_TYPE class succeeding the tree type
         * @tparam CONSTRUCTOR_ARGS (variadic) These do not have to be specified
         * but will be deduced by optionally provided function arguments args
         * @param args Whichever arguments the input object type expects.
         * (variadic template)
         * @return Shared pointer to a newly instantiated object of type

         * passed to the constructor. Also its setLink()-function is called.
